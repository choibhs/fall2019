  <span class="myDIV">In an incredible 33-0 blow out against the jets, the Pats were feeling it going off of Monday's gaming. The Jet's quarterback, Sam Darnold, could not get any rythem, as well as their whole offense. The stellar Patriots coaching staff continued to excell as the season proggressed.
  To add on to the embarrasment of the game, coach, Bill Belichick trolled the Jets after repeatedly taking a delay of game penalty in order to get a better position for the punter. The Jets, down 33, were persistent in their efforts to decline the penalty, one of the most humorous moments of the season.</span>
