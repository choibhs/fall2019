<h2>Broncos complete stunning trick play</h2><br/>

  <li class="myDIV">In a deflating loss to the Minnesota Vikings, the Broncos pulled a remarkable trick play when leading by ten in the first half.
  Wide receiver for the Broncos, Courtland Sutton, threw a 38 yard dot to Tim Patrick after getting the ball handed off to him. With a great throw and an even greater catch, the play certainly does not reflect the Broncos poor seasonal record.
  Although they blew a 20 point half time lead in the 27-23 loss, this was the true highlight of the game.</li>
