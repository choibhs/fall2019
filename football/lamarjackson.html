<ul>
  <li class="myDIV">Lamar Jackson had an incredible game against the Texans with four touchdowns and over 300 yards. He clearly outmatched the Texans' up-and-coming quarterback, Deshaun Watson, in a 41-7 beating.
  This game has embodied Lamar's whole 2019 season, as he continues to be the top NFL MVP candidate. He has led the Ravens to the current No. 1 team in the NFC, having the best offense in the league.
It does not look like Lamar will slow down any time soon.</li>
