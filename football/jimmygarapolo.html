      <span class="myDIV">It was a surprisingly tight game for the 49ers against the Cardinals in week 11. Both quarterbacks, Jimmy Garappolo (49ers) and Kyler Murray (Cardinals) had great games on the charts.
      Garoppolo, however, proved his veteran skill, coming out clutch with 4 touchdowns in the 28-25 win. Garoppolo has had an amazing season, leading the 49ers to being the No. 1 team in the AFC.
      He will certainly show up to perform well in the playoffs if he continues to have games like these.</span>
