<a><b>Attends Princeton High School in Cincinnati, Ohio</a></<b><br/>
<a><b>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</b></a><br/><a><b>#1 Nationally ranked OT / #7 Overall</b></a><br/>
<a>6-7 290 Lbs<a/><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a><b>Being 6-7 290Lbs as an Offensive Tackle makes him very fast as it shows with his "NFL-type Numbers" at his combine with 5.07 40 yard-dash, 4.53 shuttle, and a 32.5 vertical.  He is compared to Andrew Whitworth (247 Sports).  It's also a nightmare to line up against him because while at 290 pounds, let's just say Paris knows how to throw his body around.  He is a human Pancake Maker.<b/></br>
