    <span class="myDIV">Against the Redskins in their week 11 game, Mark Ingram had a performance that stood out the most in recent weeks. As a running back, he had 134 rushing yards, 21 receivin yards, and a touchdown, leading the Saints to a 43-19 win against the Redskins.
    With an RB like Ingram, the Saints are one of the top AFC teams, and are looking to compete well in the playoffs. Even if other players in the Saints offense are not performing the best, the Saints can count on a player like this to have big games and run through a defense.</span>
