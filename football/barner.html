  <li class="myDIV">Against the Panthers in week 11, Kenjon Barner returned a punt for a 78 yard touchdown, the longest punt return so far during the NFL season. It gave the Falcons a 10 point lead, and helped them to get a 29-3 victory.
    The play not only included great skill and agility from Barner himself, but nice blocks as well from his Falcons teammates. Although the Falcons have gotten off to an pretty terrible start in the season, perhaps they will be able to carry on momemtum from the win.
    The return was definitely entertaining, and this positive moment should help to bring the Falcons team back together.
