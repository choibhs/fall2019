  <p>With the Patriots at a current 9-1 record, tied for the best currently in the NFL, they have been more than successful during the regular season.
  Tom Brady, one of the greatest quarterbacks to have ever played is proving that age has not affected his ability to win games. While scouts may believe that Tommy Terrific does not have the level of talent he had in his previous years, he has not shown any immediate signs of this conclusion.
  The Pats defense has continued to execute, having allowed . The Pats will have a big shot to win the Super Bowl if they keep executing in games.</p>

  <br/>

  <a name="Ravens"><li><h3><b>Baltimore Ravens</b></h3>

  <img src="1188264027.jpg.0.jpg" width=500px><br/>

  <p>Many scouts believe the Ravens to be the overrall favorites to win the Super Bowl.
  Lamar Jackson is one of the most dangerous quarterbacks in the league, being able to run the ball effectively through a defense or build the opportunity to pass. He has already rushed for 788 yards in the season and has passed for 2,258 yards."But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
  It will be interesting to see how he plays in the big moments this coming playoffs.</p>

    <img src="bd243c6bb85541328bc4e6b119926abe.webp" width=500px><br/>

  <p>With NFL superstar Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs have proved that they have the capability of contending for the Super Bowl title. Although having a little slip up with Pat Mahomes' injury, they look ready to get back on track with a rather low record of 6-4."But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.

  <p>Deshaun Watson, one of the most talented and athletic young quarterbacks in the league along with Pat Mahomes and Lamar Jackson, have pushed the Texans to have a successful season for another year. Helped by a scorching defense, and other offensive talents, the Texans have good potential to compete in the playoffs."But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.

  <a name="Eagles"><li><h3><b>Philadelphia Eagles</b></h3>

<p>Having the worst record on this list, the Eagles may not exactly be expected to win. However, their offence has been gaining some momentum recently after a big 33-13 win against the 6-3 Bills. They will have to step it up if they want a chance to compete with other top teams."But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.
