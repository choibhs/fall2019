    <span class="myDIV">In recent months, there have been doubts of Todd Gurley's ability to perform with the Rams. He suffered a knee injury in the 2018 season, and could not get any momentum going into 2019.
    However, against the bears, he had a remarkable game, rushing for 133 yards in the Week 11 victory. His breakout game certainly raised the hopes of Gurley fans. The question remains though: <i>Can he consistently perform like this as he was exspected to in his earlier years?</i></span>
