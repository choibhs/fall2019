  <span class="myDIV">Frank Clark, the Kansas City defensive end may have had his best game in the season thus far. Clark continued to put pressure on the Chargers in the big moments, having seven pressures, two hurries, two quarterback hits, and four run stops.
  He has battled back injury and adversity in the beginning of the season to being a key weapon for the Chief's defense.
  The Chief's coaching staff has recognized the difference that Clark makes, as well as his keen focus going into every game.</span>
