<h2>Before Play</h2>


  <ul id="demo" style="display:none">

   <li> The ball should be inflated to 12in circumference.</li>
   <li> The tension of the net should be consistent throughout. A ball dropped from 3 feet above the net should bounce up approximately 12-18 in.</li>

  </ul>
<button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('demo').style.display='block'">Show Rules</button>


  <h2>During Play</h2>


    <ul id="duringplay" style="display:none">

     <li> All players except the receiver must begin the point at least 6 feet from the net.</li>
     <li> The receiver may stand at any desired distance</li>
        <li>Once the server strikes the ball, players may go any where they choose. </li>
        <li>Possession changes when the ball contacts the net.</li>
          <li>Each team has up to 3 touches per possession.   </li>
            <li>Determine a serving order which alternates players from the two teams (e.g. Player 3 follows Player 1, etc.).</li>
            <li>To equalize sun and wind effects, rotate starting positions 90 degrees counter-clockwise every 5 points if desired.</li>
    </ul>

    <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('duringplay').style.display='block'">Show Rules</button>



      <h2>Scoring</h2>


        <ul id="Scoring" style="display:none">

         <li>Roundnet is played using rally scoring; points can be won by the serving or receiving team.</li>
         <li> Games are typically played to 11, 15, or 21. In tournament play, the tournament director specifies the winning score.</li>
            <li>Games must be won by two points unless otherwise agreed upon or specified. </li>
            <li>The rally ends and a point is awarded when:<br/>-The ball contacts the ground or otherwise isn't returned onto the net within 3 touches.<br/>-The ball is hit directly into the rim at any time, including on a serve.<br/>-The ball bounces and falls back onto the net or rim.<br/>-The ball clearly rolls across the net.<br/></li>

        </ul>

        <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('Scoring').style.display='block'">Show Rules</button>

        <h2>Serving</h2>


          <ul id="Serving" style="display:none">

           <li> -If the receiving team wins the point, the next designated player serves according to the initial sequence. Otherwise, the server switches places with his/her partner and serves to the other receiving team member.</li>
           <li> -The receiving team sets their position first. The server stands 180 degrees across the designated receiver--the only player allowed to field the serve.</li>
              <li>-Serves may be struck with any amount of force; short serves are allowed.</li>
              <li>-If a server serves two faults, the receiving team wins the point. Violation of ANY of the following rules is a fault:<br/>The server must toss the ball upward at least 4 inches.<br/>If the server tosses the ball, he/she must hit it. Dropping, catching, or swinging at and missing a toss all count as a fault.</li>

          </ul>

          <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('Serving').style.display='block'">Show Rules</button>



          <h2>Rallies</h2>


            <ul id="Rallies" style="display:none">

             <li>Touches must alternate between teammates. Consecutive touches by one player result in a loss of a point.</li>
             <li>The ball must be contacted cleanly, not caught, lifted, or thrown. Players may not hit the ball with two hands, even if placed together "volleyball style".</li>
                <li>Players may use any individual part of their body to hit the ball. </li>
                <li>After the serve, any unusual bounce (i.e. pocket) that does not contact the rim is legal and playable.</li>
                  <li>A shot which lands on the net, rolls into the rim and then off the net (i.e. roll-up) is played as a pocket, not a direct rim hit.</li>
                    <li>If teams cannot determine the legality of a hit, replay the point.</li>

            </ul>

            <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('Rallies').style.display='block'">Show Rules</button>


            <h2>Infractions</h2>


              <ul id="Infractions" style="display:none">

               <li> -Remember: Player safety is paramount</li>
               <li> -Defending players must make an effort not to impede the offending team's possession or play on the ball.</li>
                  <li>-If an offender collides with a defender, or a defender's position prevents a markable offensive play on the ball, the infracted player may call "hinder" to force a replay of the point. </li>

              </ul>
