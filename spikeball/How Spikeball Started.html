<p> Spikeball started in 1989 and was marketed by a Chinese company. It failed very quickly. However later in 2003 Chris Ruder brought out his old Spikeball net and fell in love with the game. Ruder later acquired the trademark for just 800 dollars and began reviving the game. Spikeball was launched for the second time in 2008 through Ruders basement as a warehouse. By 2013 they had made over one million dollars in revenue! After Spikeball was on Shark Tank it really took off. They did not make a deal with any Sharks but still gained lots of popularity from being on the show. Today Spikeball is one of the most played games in America. Many users play on the beach or in their backyards. Its a great way to compete with your friends and have a ton of fun! Spikeballs  is to bring people together through competition and fun, and they have been very succesful doing this!
