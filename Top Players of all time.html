<title>Top Players Of All Time</title>
  <h1>Top Players of all time</h1><br/>
  <br/>
<p>The NFL has had some incredible players dating back to the league's inaugural season back in 1920. These players have helped alter the course of the game while also helping create some of the greatest dynasties in the history of the game. Several of these iconic players are still playing today.<br>
It’s one of the oldest barstool debates known to sports fans: who’s the greatest player of all time? With all the different players and styles of play throughout NFL history, how exactly are you supposed to measure that?
Do you give it to the guy with the best stats? The guy with the most wins? Or the guy with the most Super Bowl rings? Is it Jim Brown or Barry Sanders? What about Jerry Rice or Joe Montana? How about Peyton Manning or Tom Brady?</p>
