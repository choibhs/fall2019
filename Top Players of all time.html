<title>Top Players Of All Time</title>
  <h1>Top Players of all time</h1><br/>
  <br/>
<p>The NFL has had some incredible players dating back to the league's inaugural season back in 1920. These players have helped alter the course of the game while also helping create some of the greatest dynasties in the history of the game. Several of these iconic players are still playing today.<br>
It’s one of the oldest barstool debates known to sports fans: who’s the greatest player of all time? With all the different players and styles of play throughout NFL history, how exactly are you supposed to measure that?
Do you give it to the guy with the best stats? The guy with the most wins? Or the guy with the most Super Bowl rings? Is it Jim Brown or Barry Sanders? What about Jerry Rice or Joe Montana? How about Peyton Manning or Tom Brady?</p>

<h4>Running Backs:</h4>
The running back position is shifting in today's era of football, but NFL history features an impressive group of star ball-carriers.
Up until the mid-2000s, a standout in the backfield could be an overwhelming difference-maker. A few modern players have become stars, too.
Most of the best running backs in NFL history played multiple decades ago. But where do Barry Sanders and Emmitt Smith fit alongside legends such as Jim Brown and Walter Payton?<br/>

Walter Payton was highlighted by an MVP-winning 1977 season with 1,852 rushing yards and 14 touchdowns, "Sweetness" surpassed the 1,200-yard barrier 10 times. No other player in NFL history has accomplished that. Payton's career 16,726 rushing yards stood as a record upon his retirement.<br/>
Emmitt Smith obliterated the NFL's record books. After 15 years in the league, the Cowboys legend held several NFL records—most notably standing atop the chart for single-season touchdowns (25), career rushing yards (18,355) and career rushing touchdowns (164). The latter two marks remain untouched.<br/>
Jim Brown merits a higher position. However, other interests swayed him from the football field after nine years. During that successful run, the Cleveland Browns star punished defenses for a then-record 12,312 yards and 106 touchdowns on the ground. He led the NFL in rushing eight times and was a first-team All-Pro choice in each of those years. Brown, who gathered three MVP awards, a trip to nine Pro Bowls and one NFL championship, entered the Hall of Fame in 1971.<br/>
Barry Sanders propelled the Lions franchise to the playoffs five times. Unfortunately, frustration with Detroit's inability to build a contender led Sanders to retire after 10 seasons. But what a decade it was, Sanders collected 1,300-plus rushing yards a stunning nine times, topping out at 2,053 yards in a 1997 MVP season. He totaled 15,269 yards on the ground, 2,921 as a receiver and 109 combined touchdowns.<br/>
Adrian Peterson being the only active player highlighted, he entered the league as a highly regarded prospect. Throughout 12 seasons and counting, the Oklahoma product has backed up the hype. Peterson was most successful during his 10-years playing with the Minnesota Vikings, running for 2,097 yards in 2012 and narrowly missing Dickerson's single-season record. AP finished with 11,747 rushing yards and 97 touchdowns as a member of the Vikings. Already a top-10 rusher in league history, Peterson has since played for three teams—the Arizona Cardinals, New Orleans Saints and Washington Redskins. The 2007 Offensive Rookie of the Year has an MVP, seven Pro Bowls and four first-team All-Pro's on his resume.<br/>

  <h4>Wide Receivers:</h4>
  <br/>
  Dozens of wide receivers have realistic arguments for a top-5 place, and the fact that their production comes in different eras of the league only complicates the discussion. The list is based on individual production and achievements, but era-adjusted contributions also factored into the order. AFL players were also considered.<br/>

Jerry Rice is the undisputed No. 1 receiver in NFL history. No other wideout can touch the San Francisco 49ers legend's career numbers.
But after him, it's one massive debate at every single spot.
Dozens of wide receivers have realistic arguments for a top-10 place, and the fact that their production comes in different eras of the league only complicates the discussion. Picking out the 10 most worthy players is a challenging yet enjoyable task.<br/>
<br/>
Jerry Rice obliterated all of the previous receiving records, bringing in 1,549 catches for 22,895 yards and 197 touchdowns. Still, even when breaking a mark was inevitable, he still felt pressure. In addition to his several other NFL-bests, the Hall of Famer won three Super Bowls, two Offensive Player of the Year honors, appeared in 13 Pro Bowls and made 10 first-team All-Pro lists. Jerry's most famous workout to improve his ability to catch, was catching bricks from his father!!<br>
Don Hutson was the NFL's first elite receiver. He's the only player who suited up before 1945 to record 3,500 yards in his career.
Hutson wrapped up his 11 years in Green Bay at then-records of 488 receptions, 7,991 yards and 99 touchdowns. The MVP of the 1941 and 1942 seasons, he paced the league in several categories multiple times, including in receiving yards (seven), receptions (eight) and touchdowns (nine).During his career, Hutson won three championships with the Packers and earned a spot on eight All-Pro teams.<br>
Randy Moss is the only receiver other than Jerry Rice to notch 10 seasons of 1,000-plus yards—one of which happened during an Offensive Rookie of the Year effort in 1998. Six occurred in Minnesota, followed by one with Oakland and three for the Patriots.
Though Moss has since dropped out of the all-time top 10 in receptions, the six-time Pro Bowler and four-time All-Pro ranks second in touchdowns (156) and fourth in receiving yards (15,292).<br>
Terrell Owens induction into the Hall of Fame in 2018, his on-field performance demanded a place in Canton.
While "T.O." spent a majority of his career with the 49ers, he put together successful years with the Cowboys, Philadelphia Eagles, Bills and Cincinnati Bengals too. Owens registered nine seasons of 1,000-plus yards and eight with 10-plus touchdowns.
Overall, he racked up 1,078 receptions, 15,934 yards and 153 touchdowns and the latter two totals are top-three marks in NFL history. Owens gathered six Pro Bowl nods and five All-Pro honors.<br>
In 1976, the Houston Oilers used a fourth-round pick on the Tulsa wideout before trading him to Seattle in the preseason. He quickly became a featured piece of the offense and notched eight straight 1,000-yard years, excluding the strike-shortened 1982 season. Largent twice led the NFL receiving.
His career totals of 819 catches, 13,089 yards and 100 touchdowns stood atop the NFL's record books. The 1988 Walter Payton Man of the Year appeared on seven Pro Bowl teams.<br>

<br/>

<h4>Quarterbacks:</h4>
The NFL has seen plenty of quarterbacks who have changed the game, from Slingin' Sammy Baugh's introducing the concept of a gunslinger in the late '30s to Joe Montana's role in pioneering the West Coast offense.
Regardless of the strides a quarterback made in his own time, it takes something more for one to go down in history as an all-time great. Virgil Carter led the NFL in completion percentage in 1971; Cam Newton holds the record for rushing touchdowns by a quarterback; Bart Starr won the first two Super Bowls.
But to be considered among the top 10 quarterbacks of all time, a player's accomplishments and sheer talent have to transcend offensive systems, Super Bowl wins and season records.<br/>

Tom Brady may not have the mobility or arm strength of some of his contemporaries, but his other intangibles—namely, accuracy, decision-making and football IQ. His work ethic is tireless and has allowed him to overcome some of the aspects of his game that saw him fall to the sixth round in the 2000 NFL draft. He's also one of the most consistent passers in NFL history. He's never thrown more than 14 interceptions in a season and his completion rate has never dipped below 60 percent since he became a starter. Brady is also changing the way quarterbacks both train for and play the game in terms of nutrition and strength and conditioning, and he may very well go down as the oldest quarterback in NFL history before he retires. Through 2016 his stats were most certainly "GOAT" worthy. 61,582 yards; 63.8 completion percentage; 7.5 yards/attempt; 456 TDs; 152 interceptions; 1.8 interception percentage; 97.2 passer rating; five-time Super Bowl champion; four-time Super Bowl MVP; 12-time Pro Bowler; two-time NFL MVP; two-time NFL Offensive Player of the Year.<br>
Joe Montana possessed one of the most crucial traits for a great quarterback: the ability to keep calm and operate at a high level under pressure. With Joe Cool under center, his teams were never out of it. The Comeback Kid led the San Francisco 49ers to a fourth-quarter win down 16-13 with a 97-yard drive in Super Bowl XXIII. Yes, Montana won four Super Bowls and was a three-time Super Bowl MVP, which often boosts his place in rankings like these. But his No. 2 spot here is about more than his championships. When his teams needed him most, he delivered. Tom Brady's postseason stats may be better, but Montana's are nothing to sneeze at; in the 49ers' 1988-89 playoff runs, Montana threw 19 touchdowns to just one interception as San Francisco won two consecutive Lombardi trophies. Joe's numbers: 40,551 yards; 63.2 completion percentage; 7.5 yards/attempt; 273 TDs; 139 interceptions; 2.6 interception percentage; 92.3 passer rating; four-time Super Bowl champion; three-time Super Bowl MVP; eight-time Pro Bowler; two-time NFL MVP; 1989 NFL Offensive Player of the Year.<br>
Joe Montana would earn the nickname Joe Cool for his ability to keep calm under pressure, but Johnny Unitas exemplified that trait years earlier. And, like Drew Brees (6'0") would decades later, Johnny U made a name for himself as an undersized passer (6'1") who nonetheless led one of the most deadly passing offenses the league has seen. He also made his teammates believe they could win—and they did, with two NFL championships and a victory in Super Bowl V. Johnny's numbers: 40,239 yards; 54.6 completion percentage; 7.8 yards/attempt; 290 TDs; 253 interceptions; 4.9 interception percentage; 78.2 passer rating; Super Bowl V champion; two-time NFL champion; 10-time Pro Bowler; three-time NFL MVP.<br>
If you were to create a quarterback in a lab, the first thing you would give him is Peyton Manning's brain. Manning's ability to diagnose coverages, audible at the line of scrimmage and win the mental battle against opposing defensive coordinators is second to no one. Manning increased the burden of football IQ and film study irrevocably for all future passers. He also consistently made his offensive line's job easier by evading pressures; his efficiency and diagnosis ability helped him keep his sack numbers ridiculously low (303 in 17 seasons). Peyton's numbers: 71,940 yards; 65.3 completion percentage; 7.7 yards/attempt; 539 TDs; 251 interceptions; 2.7 interception percentage; 96.5 passer rating; two-time Super Bowl champion; Super Bowl XLI MVP; 14-time Pro Bowler; five-time NFL MVP; two-time NFL Offensive Player of the Year.<br>
"The Gunslinger" wasn't known for his accuracy. At 3.3 percent, Brett Favre has one of the highest interception percentages of any passer on this list—and yet he demonstrated one of the most powerful arms football has ever seen over his 20 seasons. Football's Iron Man also made a career out of his durability, setting an NFL record with 297 consecutive starts over 19 seasons and famously taking the field on Monday Night Football a day after the death of his father.
